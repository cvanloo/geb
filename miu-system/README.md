# MIU System

It's seems that you can't get from MI -> MU, since there is no way to
get a number of I's that is a multiple of 3.

- We can keep doubling the I's using rule II (Mx -> Mxx)
- This means that there can only be a number of I's that is a multiple of 2 (except for the initial state MI)
- We can turn 3 III's into a U (rule III)
- Since the number of I's cannot be a multiple of 3, we will always have some left-over I's
